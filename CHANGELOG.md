## 1.2.5 - April 19, 2015
* Fix object pattern with operator key.

## 1.2.4 - Dec 2, 2014
* Fixed xregexp path on systems with case sensitive file names. (Thanks @geluspeculum)
* Better message when input file cannot be read.

## 1.2.3 - Sep 30, 2014
* Fixed delete expressions.

## 1.2.2 - Sep 25, 2014
* Fixed bug where compiler would inline indirect recursive calls forever.

## 1.2.1 - Sep 23, 2014
* Fixed immutable assignments in chained assignment statements not propagating
  immutablity correctly, and therefore not taking full advantage of constant propagating.
* Relaxed some restrictions on working binding prop.

## 1.2.0 - Sep 22, 2014
* Support for identifier alias exports.
** `package (x # alias) { ... }`
* Support for with and try body lambdas.
** `\x -> try { ... } catch (e) { ... } finally { ... }`
** `\x -> with import 'x' x in { ... }`
* Restricted bindings so that they may only be marked immutable if they have
  not previously been mutated in any enclosed scope.
* Better performance of slice unpacks.
** For inlined functions with know args targets, results in no call overhead.
* Added `<<|` and `|>>` to apply a function to an array of args.
** `var (<<|) = \f args -> f.apply(null, args);`
** `var (|>>) = \args f -> f.apply(null, args);`
* Fixed bug where lambdas in loops did not properly capture closure values.
* Removed Python watcher.
** Always use `-w` on main Khepri executable.

## 1.1.3 - Sep 9, 2014
* Fixed potential call stack issue for large programs.

## 1.1.2 - Sep 9, 2014
* Fixed `??` lexed as puctuator instead of operator.
* Fixed `(??, 1)` needing comma.

## 1.1.0 - Sep 8, 2014
* Added the checked operator `??`:
** Pseudo code is: `var (??) := \o f -> o && f o;`
** Allows writing safe member accessors: `o??.x`
** RHS lazily evaluated.
* Added support for generalized dot expressions
** These are unary functions that operate on a object: `.x` is `\o -> o.x`
** Dot expressions may contain any call or accessor: `.x.f(1 + 2).(computed)`
** Can be used almost anywhere: `.type \> (=== 'x')`
* Added support for checked object and array patterns `\?{x b}`.
** Ensures that base is a valid object before evaluating all child elements.
** All sub patterns of a checked pattern are implicitly checked.

** Operators inherit precedence from their prefix op `1 +? 2 *> 3` is `(1 +? (2 *> 3));`
* Changed argument unpack syntax to require a prefixed `-`. `\-args(x ...)-> ...`
** Allows the parser to produce better error messages and support operators in the
  parameter list `\(+) -> 1 + 2;`
* Removed the not very useful unary operator curry syntax.
* Allow a curried binary operator to omit the comma for the argument in most cases.
** The two exceptions being `(new, x)` and `(., x)`;

## 0.24.8 - April 19, 2014
* When compiling a file, compiler error messages display the file
  name where the error occurred. Useful when compiling multiple files in a dir.
* Better error message for undefined var.

## 0.24.7 - April 19, 2014

* Better generated code when an argument to an inlined function is not provided,
  so it evaluates to undefined.
** `var f := \x -> x.x; f();` will output `undefined.x;`
* Object literal keys may be identifiers or numbers.

## 0.22.1 - April 8, 2014
* Restored support for ellipsis pattern without id.

## 0.22.0 - April 8, 2014

## 0.21.14 - April 7, 2014
* Fixed amd package generation for imports.

## 0.21.13 - April 7, 2014
* Globals pruned if inlining makes them unreachable.
** `(+, 1);` generates `\y -> y + 1` with no `_add`
** While `(+)` generates `var __add = \x y -> x + y; __add;`
* Fixed potentially incorrect normalization of let bindings with a let expression
  value.
* Unused declarators without inits can also be pruned.

## 0.21.12 - April 6, 2014
* Basic unreachable binding pruning.
** Compose now should have same overhead as a `compose` function in the worst case,

  a function instead of an new function where ever the op appears.
** Inlining may then expand these.
* Improvements to inlining.

* Split compiler code into own library `khepri-compile`.

## 0.17.1 - March 2, 2014
* Added node file watcher to compiler
** Use `-w` or `--watch` flag.
** All standard options/flags will work with the watcher.

## 0.17.0 - Feb 26, 2014
* Added support for immutable, non-recursive variable declarations.
* Added back syntax `(+, 1)` to curry args on operator.

## 0.16.6 - Feb 24, 2014
* Non package programs generate 'use strict' code.
* Fixed AMD modules potentially not setting 'use strict'.

## 0.16.4 - Feb 23, 2014

* Better generated code for forms: `(UNARY_OP)@ARG` and `(BIN_OP)@arg`.
** Expression like `(+)@1` generate `var x = 1; function(y) { return x + y; }`
* Better generated code for forms: (\ARGS -> BODY) @ CURRY_ARGS
** Note that unused args are silently discarded. `(\_ -> 1) @ f();` never evaluates
   `f()`.

## 0.14.1 - Feb 19, 2014
* Fixed constant folding of unary `++` and `--`.
* Moved scope datastructures to use hashtrie.

## 0.14.0 - Feb 19, 2014

* Fixed curry expression with argument list.

## 0.13.0 - January 31, 2014
* Removed `TupleExpression`.
* Split `ApplicationExpression` from regular `CallExpression.`
** Application has lower precedence than curry. `f x`
** Call has same precedence as member expressions. This allows chaining of calls
  and member access. `f(1).z.w(34).g`

## 0.12.0 - January 30, 2014
* Allow `TupleExpression` as valid subexpressions. If not used in a call or curry,
  these are mapped to Javascript sequence expressions.
** Changes AST output of primary expressions.
* Fixed forms `f(+)` for operator expressions which translates to `f((+))`.
* Improved nested currying of curried expression so `f@1@2@3` generates `f.bind(null, 1, 2, 3);`

## 0.11.4 - January 29, 2014

** `f@1`, `f@(1,2)`
* Restricted numbers to always require digits both before and after the decimal.
* Changed computed member syntax:
** `x.(1 + 3)`
* Added unparened function application syntax:
** `f x y // f(x)(y)`
** Left associative
** Js syntax is still supported for multi argument functions `f(1, 2, 3)`
** Lower precedence then curry.
* Renamed unary plus to `++` and unary minus to `--`.

## 0.10.0 - January 26, 2014
* Changed conditional expression syntax.
** Now prefixed by `?` followed by the test then the two choices prefixed with `:`.
** This simplifies the grammar and makes it possible to use conditional
  expressions in the test without parens. `??x>3:10:4:6:7;`
* Allow package managers to customize behavior of `with` imports.

## 0.9.0 - January 19, 2014
* Fat arrow `this` unpacks.
** `\x y =self-> self.z + x + y;`
* Removed `this` expressions.
** Always use explicit fat arrow to unpack `this`.
* Removed standard ECMAScript function syntax: `function(x) {...}`
** Use `function\ x -> {...}` instead.

* Added support for generic separator for packages `::`.

## 0.8.1 - January 19, 2014
* Improvements to `watch.py`.
** Fixed double compiling.
** Auto delete files.
** Clearer output.
** Argument forwarding.
* Added experimental support for node package manager.
** Use the `--package_manager=node` flag to generate node style packages.
* Fixed function expressions discarding `"use strict"` if used with patterns.

## 0.8.0 - December 18, 2013
* Updated pattern grammar to disallow some weird forms including:
** `{'a': ...}`, `{'a': _}` for object patterns
** `a#b#c#d` and `a#...` or `a#_`. As Patterns are now
  restricted to targeting only object and array patterns.
* Updated statement grammar to restrict assignment and delete expressions
  to top level expressions.
** They are disallowed in return and throw arguments, if tests, switch tests,
  while and do while conditions, and for test expressions.
** Only expression statements and the for init and update expressions can use 
  deletion or assignment.
* Added more specific parser error messages.
* Changed lambda to capture all expressions, including compose and pipe.
* Added the `@` expression for unparenthesized function calls.
** Takes arbitrary number of arguments separated by `:`.

## 0.7.2 - December 17, 2013
* Rewrote to eliminate most AST mutation.
* Added a few peephole optimizes/rewrites.
* Divided stages better.

## 0.7.1 - December 17, 2013
* Optimized the case `return let` to not use extra function.

## 0.7.0 - December 15, 2013
* Changed pattern and package syntax to allow all commas to be omitted.
** Existing patterns are not effected.
* Changed aliased object and pattern syntax to to require the `#` symbol between
  top level aliases and the pattern, `let list#[e0, e1] =[1,2] in ...`.
* Fixed the syntax `function f(args(...)) {};` being allowed. Should always be
  `function f\args(...) -> { };` instead.
* Improved error messages for patterns.
* Allow unnamed as at the top level of object patterns: `let {x#{y}} = {} in y;`
* Fixed imports being allowed in elements like functions.

## 0.6.0 - December 9, 2013
* Added `void` back.
* Added syntax for named lambda functions with all unpacks:
    `function fun \args(x, ...) -> x`
** Hybrid of base ecmascript function expression and Khepri lambda expression.
** Syntaxes:
*** `var fun = function fun \args(x, ...) -> x`
*** `var fun = function \args(x, ...) -> x`
*** `var fun = function fun(x, ...) { return x; } // no args unpack`
*** `var fun = \args(x, ...) -> { return x; }`
*** `var fun = \args(x, ...) ->  x;`
*** `var fun = \x, ... -> x;`

## 0.5.5 - December 9, 2013
* Fixed let expressions hiding `this` values.

## 0.5.4 - November 22, 2013
* `watch.py` generate directories for files if they do not exist.
* Updated to `khepri_ast` V3
* Moved generated files to `dist`.

## 0.5.3 - November 15, 2013
* Fixed sink pattern creating empty declarations if used in unpacks.
* Update to Nu V3, Parse V16.

## 0.5.2 - November 10, 2013

* Fixed allowing usage of generated identifiers from object and array patterns.
* Fixed bug preventing use of nested object patterns.

## 0.5.0 - November 4, 2013
* Removed object literal get and setter syntax.
** Get and set are no longer keywords.
* Removed prefix decimal number support.
** All numbers must start with a digit.
* Added reversed versions of compose and pipeline operator.
* Added versions of compose and pipeline operator to support multiple args.
* Changed existing compose operator to pass a single argument.
* Removed support for all compound assignment operators.
** Also will lex to puctuator plus assignment op.
* Added `_` pattern for unused var.
** `_` is a reserved word but words can contain or begin with `_` (like other
  reserved words.)
* Removed the `void` operator.
* Delete can only be used as a top level expression.
* Removed support for multi value bracket accessor.

## 0.4.2 - October 29, 2013
* Fixed lexical transform for ids using building names.

* Added pipeline and compose operators.
* Added syntax for currying functions.
* Added ability to transform operators to functions.

## 0.3.1 - October 16, 2013
* Made the lexical requirements for packages and the with statement correct,
  stricter than they were previously.
** Package exports may not be duplicated.
** With body may not declare a variable that conflicts with any with binding.
** Package with bindings must not conflict with any package exports.
* Fixed object patterns not always working for explicit unpacks.

## 0.3.0 - October 14, 2013
* Repurposed the with statement to behave like a statement level let expression.
** With statements can also be used to import a package locally using the import
  pattern.
* Changed syntax for package imports slightly so that section after the import
  may be either a with statement or a block statement. This requires the
  addition of the `in` keyword for existing packages using the with statement.
* Fixed switch cases not being lexical checked.
* Packages may now also have circular dependencies. Packages  imported
  in a package level with statement will be loaded (or marked for loading if there
  is an circular dep), before the package body executed. At this point, top level
  packages should be assumed to be undefined until the package body completes.
  This means that they cannot be unpacked at the moment.
* Removed pase-ecma dep.

## 0.2.0 - October 11, 2013
* Let expressions can also use patterns to unpack their result.
* Generated tree uses only ECMA nodes.
* Added shorthand for unpacking values with same key as identifier in object patterns.
* Added packages syntax.
** Allows defining package exports and imports.
** Import uses object unpacking syntax.
** Currently require js is targeted but other module loaded could be used.

## 0.1.0 - July 27, 2013
* Added object and array patterns.
